# Contributer's Guide
## Raising an Issue to Encourage a Contribution
If you notice a problem with the project that you believe needs improvement but you're unable to make the change yourself, you should raise a Github issue containing a clear description of the problem. Include relevant snippets of the content and/or screenshots if applicable. I regularly review issue lists and your issue will be prioritized and addressed as appropriate.

## Submitting a Pull Request to Suggest an Improvement
If you see an opportunity for improvement and can make the change yourself go ahead and use a typical git workflow to make it happen:

* Fork this curriculum repository
* Make the change on your fork, with descriptive commits in standard format
* Open a Pull Request against this repo
I will review the changes and approve or comment on them in due course.
